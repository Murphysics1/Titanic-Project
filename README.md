# Titanic Project


Decision Tree classification of the Titanic Disaster 

Final model worked out to be 84%. Expected, yet still upsetting, that wealth was a key factor in the survival rate of this distaster. It was also interesting to see that passengers with large families tended to have a lower survival rate. I'm guessing family's would rather go down together than to split apart.
